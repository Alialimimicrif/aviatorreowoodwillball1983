## Aviator 1Win Game Guide -- How to Play and Win

Aviator is a game of timing and strategy, where players aim to withdraw
their bets before the plane "crashes" or disappears.

1.  **Placing Your Bets** -- Select your bet amount and place up to two
    bets per round for added strategy.
2.  **Watching the Multiplier** -- The multiplier begins at 1x and
    increases as the plane ascends.

mechanics are based on a **random number generator (RNG)**, ensuring
each round's outcome is unique and fair.
